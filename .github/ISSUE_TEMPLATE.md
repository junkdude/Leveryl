<!--
RULES:
 - Make sure that you are using the latest supported version before opening an issue.
 - Test it on a clean test server, WITHOUT PLUGINS, to see if the issue still occurs. If not then it may be a plugin issue. Please also indicate the result of such tests.
 - Search the issue tracker to check if anyone has already reported it, to avoid needlessly creating duplicate issues. Make sure you also check closed issues, as an issue you think is valid may already have been resolved.
 - If your issue is related to a plugin, do not report here, contact the plugin's original author instead.
 - Support requests are not bugs. Issues such as "How do I do this" are not bugs and will be closed. If you need help, please see here and do not misuse our issue tracker.
 - No generic titles such as "Question", "Help", "Crash Report" etc. A good issue report provides a quick summary in the title. If you just got a crash report but you don't understand it, please look for a line starting with Message. It summarizes the bug.
 - Information must be provided in the issue body, not in the title. No tags like [BUG] are allowed in the title, including [SOLVED] for solved issues.
 - To express appreciation, objection, confusion or other supported reactions on pull requests, issues or comments on them, use GitHub reactions rather than posting an individual comment with an emoji only. This helps keeping the issue/pull request conversation clean and readable.
